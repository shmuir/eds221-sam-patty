## Fiddler Crabs

The latitide and water temperature can have an effect on Fiddler Crab sizes.

Here is a plot of fiddler crab carapace widths observed at the different latitudes.

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Crab carapace width based on latitude and water temperature"
#| 
ggplot(data = pie_crab, aes(x = latitude, y = size, color = water_temp)) + 
  geom_jitter() +
  theme_linedraw() +
  labs(y = "carapace width (cm)", color = "Water temp. (ÂºC)")
```

Here is a summary table containing the mean, standard deviation, and sample size of fiddler crab carapace widths by site. 

```{r}
pie_crab %>%
  group_by(site) %>%
  summarise(`Mean Size` = mean(size), 
            `SD Size` = sd(size), 
            Count = n()) 
```
